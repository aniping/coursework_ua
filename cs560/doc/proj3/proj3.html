<P>
In this assignment, you will implement a B+ tree in which leaf level pages contain entries of the form 
[key, rid of a data record] (Alternative 2 for data entries, in terms of the textbook.) 
You must implement the full search and insert algorithms as discussed in class. 
In particular, your insert routine must be capable of dealing with overflows (at any level of the tree) by splitting pages; namely, you do need to implement sibling redistribution 
when a page splits.
Deletes will be handled by simply marking the corresponding leaf entry as &lsquo;<b>deleted</b>&rsquo;.  
You do not need to implement <i>merging of nodes on deletes</i> or <i>sibling redistribution on inserts</i><!--(the latter is described at the bottom of p.259 into 260)-->.
</P>
<P>
You will be given <i>HFPage</i> and <i>SortedPage</i>. 
SortedPage is derived from HFPage, and it augments the <b><i>insertRecord</i></b> method of HFPage by storing records on the HFPage in sorted order by a specified key value. 
The key value must be included as the initial part of each inserted record, to enable easy comparison of the key value of a new record with the key values of existing records on a page. 
The documentation available in the header files is sufficient to understand what operation each function performs.
</P>
<P>
You need to implement two page-level classes, <i>BTIndexPage</i> and <i>BTLeafPage</i>, 
both of which are derived from SortedPage. 
These page classes are used to build the B+ tree index. 
You will write code to <i>create</i>, <i>destroy</i>, <i>open</i> and <i>close</i> for a B+ tree index. 
You will also write code that will open a <i>scan</i> on the B+ tree, allowing its caller to iterate through all of the data entries 
(from the leaf pages) that satisfy the stated search criterion. 
</p>

<!--<B><font color="blue" size = 4.5>3 Design Overview</font></B><P>-->
<div class="MsoNormal"><h2><b><font color="#3333FF">Design Overview</font></b></h2></div>
<P>
You should begin by (re-)reading the chapter Tree Structured Indexing of the textbook and reviewing the corresponding lecture to get an overview of the B+ tree layer. 
<!--There is also information about the B+ tree layer in the HTML documentation.-->
</P>

<div class="MsoNormal"><h3><b><font color="#3333FF">A Note on 'Keys' for this Assignment</font></b></h3></div>
<P>
You should note that key values are passed to functions using <b><TT>void *</TT></b> pointers (pointing to the key values). 
The contents of a key should be interpreted using the <TT>AttrType</TT> variable. 
The key can be either a string (<TT>attrString</TT>) or an integer (<TT>attrInteger</TT>), as per the definition of <TT>AttrType</TT> in <i>minirel.h</i>. 
We just implement these two kinds of keys in this assignment. 
If the key is a string, it has a fixed maximum length, <TT>MAX_KEY_SIZE1</TT>, defined in <i>bt.h</i>. 
</P>
<P>
Although the specifications for some methods (e.g., the constructor of <i>BTreeFile</i>) suggest that keys can be of (the more general enumerated) type <TT>AttrType</TT>, 
you can return an error message if the keys are not of type <TT>attrString</TT> or <TT>attrInteger</TT>. 
</P>
<P>
The <i>SortedPage</i> class, which augments the <i>insertRecord</i> method of <i>HFPage</i> by storing records on a page in sorted order according to a specified key value, assumes that the key value is included as the initial part of each record, to enable easy comparison of the key value of a new record with the key values of existing records on a page. 
</P>

<!--<B><font color="blue" size = 3.5>3.2 B+ Tree Page-Level Classes</font></B><P>-->
<div class="MsoNormal"><h3><b><font color="#3333FF">B+ Tree Page-Level Classes</font></b></h3></div>

<P>
There are four separate page classes, of which you will implement two. 
<i>HFPage</i> is the base class (your own), and from it is derived <i>SortedPage</i>. 
You will derive <i>BTIndexPage</i> and <i>BTLeafPage</i> from <i>SortedPage</i>. 
Note that, as in the <i>HFPage</i> assignment, you <b>must not add any private data members</b> to <i>BTIndexPage</i> or <i>BTLeafPage</i>. 
</P>

<P>
<UL>
<li><i>HFPage</i>: This is the base class. You have already implemented this class in Project 1.<P>
<li><i>SortedPage</i>: This class is derived from the class <i>HFPage</i>.
Its only function is to maintain records on a HFPage in a sorted order. 
Only the slot directory is re-arranged. 
The data records remain in the same positions on the page. 
This exploits the fact that the rids of index entries are not important: index entries (unlike data records) are never &lsquo;pointed to&rsquo; directly, and are only accessed 
by searching the index page. <P>
<li><i>BTIndexPage</i>: This class is derived from SortedPage. It inserts records of the type [<i>key</i>, <i>pageNo</i>] 
on the SortedPage. The records are sorted by the key. <P>
<li><i>BTLeafPage</i>: This class is derived from SortedPage. It inserts records of the type [<i>key</i>, <i>dataRid</i>] on the <i>SortedPage</b></i>. 
<i>dataRid</i> is the rid of the data record. 
The records are sorted by the key. 
Further, leaf pages must be maintained in a doubly-linked list. 
</ul>
</P>

For further details about the individual methods in these classes, look at the header pages for the class. 

<P>
Lastly, you will need to create a structure to represent the header page of the B+ tree. 
Despite its name, the data structure used to represent the header page need not be derived from a <i>Page</i> object.  
It can be implemented simply as a C++ struct, with a field for each piece of information that must be stored in the header page.  
Just remember to cast pointers to this struct as (<TT>Page *</TT>) pointers when making calls to functions such as <i>pinPage()</i>.
</P>

<!--<B><font color="blue" size = 3.5>3.3 Other B+ Tree Classes</font></B><P>-->
<div class="MsoNormal"><h3><b><font color="#3333FF">Other B+ Tree Classes</font></b></h3></div>

<P>
We will assume here that everyone understands the concept of B+ trees, and the basic algorithms, and concentrate on explaining the design of the C++ classes that you will implement. 
</P>

<P>
A <i>BTreeFile</i> will contain a header page and a number of <i>BTIndexPages</i> and <b></i>BTLeafPages</b></i>. 
The header page is used to hold information about the tree as a whole, such as the page id of the root page, the type of the search key, the length of the key field(s) (which has a fixed maximum size in this assignment), etc. 
When a B+ tree index is opened, you should read the header page first, and keep it pinned until the file is closed. 
Given the name of the B+ tree index file, how can you locate the header page? 
The DB class has a method 
</P>
<pre>
Status add_file_entry(const char* fname, PageId header_page_num); 
</pre>

<p>
that lets you register this information when a file <i>fname</i> is created. 
There are similar methods for deleting and reading these &lsquo;file entries&rsquo; ([<i>file name</i>, <i>header page</i>] pairs) as well, which can be used when the file is 
destroyed or opened (See <a href="db.h">here</a>). 
The header page contains the page id of the root of the tree, and every other page in the tree is accessed through the root page. 
</P>

<P>
The following two figures show examples of how a valid B+ Tree might look.
</P>

<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="fig1.jpg"></CENTER>
</P>

<P>
Figure 1 shows what a <i>BTreeFile</i>  with only one <i>BTLeafPage</i> looks like; the single leaf page is also the root. 
Note that there is no <i>BTIndexPage</i>  in this case.
</P>

<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="fig2.jpg"><P></CENTER>
</P>

<P>Figure 2 shows a tree with a few BTLeafPages, 
and this can easily be extended to contain multiple levels of BTIndexPages as well. <P>
</P>

<!--<B><font color="blue" size = 2.5>3.3.1 IndexFile and IndexFileScan</font></B><P>-->
<div class="MsoNormal"><h4><b><font color="#3333FF">IndexFile and IndexFileScan</font></b></h4></div>

<P>
A <i>BTree</i> is one particular type of index. There are other types, for example a <i>Hash</i> index. 
However, all index types have some basic functionality in common. 
We've taken this basic index functionality and created a virtual base class called <i>IndexFile</i>. 
You won't write any code for <i>IndexFile</i>. 
However, any class derived from an <i>IndexFile</i> should support <i>IndexFile()</i>, <i>Delete()</i>, and <i>insert()</i>. 
(<i>IndexFile</i> and <i>IndexFileScan</i> are defined in <a href="index.h">here</a>). 
</P>

<P>
Likewise, an <i>IndexFileScan</i> is a virtual base class that contains the basic functionality all index file scans should support. 
<P>

<!--<B><font color="blue" size = 2.5>3.3.2 BTreeFile</font></B><P>-->
<div class="MsoNormal"><h4><b><font color="#3333FF">BTreeFile</font></b></h4></div>

<P>
The main class to be implemented for this assignment is <i>BTreeFile</i>. 
<i>BTreeFile</i> is a derived class of the <i>IndexFile</i> class, which means a <i>BTreeFile</i> is a kind of <i>IndexFile</i>. 
However, since <i>IndexFile</i> is a virtual base class all of the methods associated with <i>IndexFile</i> must be implemented for <i>BTreeFile</i>. 
You should have copied <i>btfile.h</i> into your directory, as per the instructions in the Getting Started Section. 
</P>

<P>
The methods to be implemented include: 
</P>

<P>
<b>BTreeFile::BTreeFile</b> There are two constructors for <i>BTreeFile</i> (as defined in <i>btfile.h</i>): one that will only open an index, and another that will create a new index on disk, with a given type and key size. 
Observe that the key type is passed as a value of type <TT>AttrType</TT>. 
For this assignment, you only need to handle keys of type <TT>attrString</TT> and <TT>attrInteger</TT>. 
If there is a call with a key whose type is not one of the two, return an error. 
</P>

<P>
<b>BTreeFile::insert</b> The <i>BTreeFile::insert</i> method takes two arguments: (a pointer to) a <i>key</i> and the <i>rid</i> of a data record. 
The data entry to be inserted---i.e., a &lsquo;record&rsquo; in the leaf pages of the <i>BTreeFile</i> ---consists of the pair [<i>key</i>, <i>rid of data record</i>].
</P>

<P>
If a page overflows (i.e., no space for the new entry), you should split the page. 
You may have to insert additional entries of the form [<i>key</i>, <i>id of child page</i>] into the higher level index pages as part of a split. 
Note that this could recursively go all the way up to the root, possibly resulting in a split of the root node of the B+ tree. 
</P>

<P>
<b>BTreeFile::Delete</b> The <b>BTreeFile::Delete</b> routine simply removes the entry from the appropriate <i>BTLeafPage</i>. 
You are not required to implement redistribution or page merging when the number of entries falls below threshold. <P>
</P>

<!--<B><font color="blue" size = 2.5>3.3.3 BTreeFileScan</font></B><P>-->
<div class="MsoNormal"><h4><b><font color="#3333FF">BTreeFileScan</font></b></h4></div>

<P>
Finally, you will implement scans that return data entries from the leaf pages of the tree. 
You will create the scan through a member function of <i>BTreeFile</i> (<i>BtreeFile::new_scan(...)</i> as defined in <i>btfile.h</i>).
 <!-- so that you can report an error if a BTreeFile is closed before a scan is completed. -->
The parameters passed to <i>new_scan()</i> specify the range of keys that will be scanned in the B+ tree.
They are explained in detail in <i>btfile.h</i>.<p>
</P>
<!--<B><font color="blue" size = 3.5>3.4 Errors</font></B><P>-->
<div class="MsoNormal"><h3><b><font color="#3333FF">Errors</font></b></h3></div>

<P>
In the previous projects, you learned how to use the Minibase error protocol. 
Reviewing it now would be a good idea. 
In that assignment, all the errors you returned belonged to one of the categories in new <i>error.h</i>, namely <TT>BUFMGR</TT>. 
In this assignment, you will need to use <TT>BTREE</TT>, <TT>BTLEAFPAGE</TT>, and <TT>BTINDEXPAGE</TT>.

<p>
<ul><h3><b><font color="blue">A Note on the Due Date</font></b></h3>
<li>This assignment is <i>significantly more challenging </i> than the first two; not only does it build upon your understanding of the previous two coding assignments (as you must make use of both the <i>Page</i> classes and your <i>Buffer Manager</i>), you are also also called upon to implement a rather intricate data structure.  
<!--Accordingly, we have given you extra time to complete this part of the project.-->
You have roughly two and a half weeks, and you will need them. 
If you don't start working on this assignment today, you're <b><font color="#FF0000">already behind!</font></b>
</li>
</ul>
<ul><h3><b><font color="blue">A Note on Code Comments</font></b></h3>
<li>
You are responsible for making your implementation understandable to other programmers, in particular the grader. 
If there is anything about your implementation that would not be apparent at first glance, you may wish to provide additional documentation of it.
</li>
</ul>
<ul><h3><b><font color="blue">A Note on Plagiarism</font></b></h3>
<li>Never make any attempt to search on the web for any source code related to this B+ tree layer. The B+ tree layer for Project 3 should be your own implementation.
<li>We will be running plagiarism-checking software against each group's code as before. We will compare each group's submission against all other groups, including submissions from previous semesters. Don't copy someone else's code!</li>

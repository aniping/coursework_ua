In this assignment, you will implement a simple buffer management layer (without support for concurrency control and recovery) for the Minibase database system. 
You can keep using <a href="http://www.cs.arizona.edu/classes/cs560/spring17/project/proj1/spaceMgr/dsm.html">Disk Space Manager</a> library provided in <a href="http://www.cs.arizona.edu/classes/cs560/spring17/project/proj1/proj1.html">Project 1</a>. 
HTML documentation for Minibase is available on the <a href="../project.html">project</a> webpage. In particular, again you should carefully read the description of the <a href="./db.h">DB</a> class, which you will use extensively in this assignment.

<p>
<ul><h3><b><font color="blue">Notes</font></b></h3>
<!--<li>The Minibase buffer manager layer differs from what you have to implement in that it contains methods to support concurrency control and recovery.</li>-->
<li>Never try to decompile the existing buffer manager&#39;s library (<i>buf.a</i>) code. 
If your buffer manager code looks similar to the decompiled one, you will get <b><font color="#FF0000">ZERO</font></b> in this project. In addition, never make any attempt to search on the web for any source code related to buffer management. The buffer manager layer for Project 2 should be your own implementation.
</ul>
</p>

<!--<b><font color="#3333FF">Where to Find Makefiles, Code, etc.</font></b>

Note that there are also other directories distributed for <a href="http://www.cs.arizona.edu/classes/cs560/spring17/project/proj1/proj1.html">Project 1</a>. Instead of the buffer manager library (<i>buf.a</i>) provided in project 1, your buffer manager will be also tested on your HeapFile and HFPage implementations. If your HPage or HeapFile does not properly work, you need to fix it before proceeding with Project 2. Make sure that when your buffer manager is invoked, the same output should be displayed in both tests of HeapFile and HFPage of project 1.</p>

<p>
The simplified buffer manager interface that you will implement allows a higher level program to allocate and deallocate pages on disk, 
to bring a disk page to the buffer pool and pin it, and to unpin a page in the buffer pool.</p>

The methods that you have to implement are described below:

   	// Initializes a buffer manager managing "numbuf" buffers.

<L1><B><font color="blue" size = 4.5>Design Overview and Implementation Details</font></B></L1> 

<p>The <i>buffer pool</i> is a collection of <i>frames</i> (page-sized sequence of main memory bytes) that is managed by the Buffer Manager. 
It should be stored as an array <b>bufPool[numbuf]</b> of Page objects. 
In addition, you should maintain an array <b>bufDescr[numbuf]</b> of <i>descriptors</i>, one per frame. 
Each descriptor is a record with the following fields:

<center>
<p><i>page number, pin_count, dirtybit</i></p>
</center>

<p>The <i>pin_count</i> field is an integer, <i>page number</i> is a <b>PageId</b> object, and <i>dirtybit</i> is a boolean. 

This describes the page that is stored in the corresponding frame. A page is identified by a <i>page
number</i> that is generated by the DB class when the page is allocated,
and is unique over all pages in the database. The <b>PageId</b> type is
defined as an integer type in minirel.h.
<p>A simple <i>hash table</i> should be used to figure out what frame a
given disk page occupies.The hash table should be implemented (entirely
in main memory) by using an array of pointers to lists of &lt;<i>page number,
frame number</i>> pairs. The array is called the <i>directory</i> and each
list of pairs is called a
<i>bucket</i>. Given a <i>page number</i>, you
should apply a <i>hash function</i> to find the directory entry pointing
to the bucket that contains the frame number for this page, if the page
is in the buffer pool. If you search the bucket and don't find a pair containing
this page number, the page is not in the pool. If you find such a pair,
it will tell you the frame in which the page resides. This is illustrated
in Figure 1:
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<table>
<tr>
<td>
<div style="margin-left: .5in"><img SRC="image001.gif" BORDER=0 height=420 width=747 align=RIGHT></div>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>The hash function must distribute values in the domain of the search
field uniformly over the collection of buckets. If we have HTSIZE buckets,
numbered 0 through M-1, a hash function <i>h </i>of the form
<center>
<p><img SRC="image003.gif" BORDER=0 height=23 width=249></center>

<p>works well in practice. HTSIZE should be chosen to be a prime number.
When a page is requested the buffer manager should do the following: Check
the buffer pool (by using the hash table) to see if it contains the requested
page. If the page is not in the pool, it should be brought in as follows:
<ul>
<li>
Choose a frame for replacement, using the LOVE/HATE replacement policy.</li>

<li>
If the frame chosen for replacement is dirty,&nbsp; <i>flush</i> it (i.e.,
write out the page that it contains to disk, using the appropriate DB class
method).</li>

<li>
Read the requested page (again, by calling the DB class) into the frame
chosen for replacement; the <i>pin_count</i> and <i>dirtybit</i> for the
frame should be initialized to 0 and FALSE, respectively.</li>

<li>
Delete the entry for the old page from the Buffer Manager's hash table
and insert an entry for the new page. Also, update the entry for this frame
in the <b>bufDescr</b> array to reflect these changes.</li>

<li>
<i>Pin</i> the requested page by incrementing the <i>pin_count</i> in the
descriptor for this frame and return a pointer to the page to the requester.</li>
</ul>
<span style="color:blue"><b>The Love/Hate replacement policy</b></span>
<p><span style="color:black">Theoretically, the best candidate page for
replacement is the page that will be last requested in the future. Since
implementing such policy requires a future predicting oracle, all buffer
replacement policies try to approximate it one way or another. The LRU
policy, for example, uses the past access pattern as an indication for
the future. However, sequential flooding can ruin this scheme and MRU becomes
more appropriate in this particular situation. In this assignment you are
supposed to implement the <i>love/hate</i> replacement policy. The policy
tries to enhance prediction of the future by relying on a hint from the
upper levels about the page. The upper level user hints the buffer manager
that the page is <i>loved</i> if it is more likely that the page will be
needed in the future, and <i>hated</i> if it is more likely that the page
will not be needed. The policy is supposed to maintain an MRU list for
the hated pages and an LRU list for the loved pages. If a page is needed
for replacement, the buffer manager selects from the list of hated pages
first and then from the loved pages if no hated ones exist.<o:p></o:p></span>
<p><span style="color:black">A situation may arise when a page is both
loved and hated at the same time. This can happen if the page was pinned
by two different users and then was unpinned by the first one as a hated
page and by the other as a loved page. In this case, assume that "love
conquers hate", meaning that once a page is indicated as loved it should
remain loved.&nbsp;</span>
